[CV](https://pao214.github.io/assets/cv.pdf)

Hello! My name is Bvsk Patnaik, and I am a software engineer by profession. I work broadly on areas relating to systems design and implementation. Currently, I am a blockchain developer working at Marlin Labs. Prior to joining the startup, I worked at a [Tower Research Capital](https://www.tower-research.com/) in a core library team responsible for market data, designing APIs and developing low-latency software for our trading clients.

I completed my undergraduate studies at [IITD](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I was mentored by [Prof. Sorav Bansal](https://sorav.compiler.ai/) for my undergraduate project on *Optimizing the performance of memory-intensive applications*.

In my free time, I explore my curiosity by taking online courses. Recently, I started meditating every day after learning about the positive effects of the practice through the Coursera course on [Buddhism and Modern Psychology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation). Below are some other online courses that I've thoroughly enjoyed

**Coursera**

* [Model Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking)
* [Child Nutrition and Cooking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/childnutrition)
* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
